Variables Creation Rules

* A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
* A variable name cannot start with a number.
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
* Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables).
* Variables can store different data types, like integers, strings, arrays, etc.
* PHP is loosely typed, so you don’t need to declare a data type explicitly.
* Variable values can change during the script’s execution.
